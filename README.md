# CSSE374-Final-Project

## Design


## Usage Instructions
This tool is designed for use on Windows and to be run from Eclipse. It is possible to be run outside of Eclipse, but instructions to do so will not be provided here.

1. Download GraphViz from <http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php>
  * Make sure to download the .zip version
2. Extract the zipped GraphViz folder
  * There should be an executable named dot inside of this folder
3. Add the path of this folder to your PATH system variable
4. Import the project in this repository to Eclipse
5. Change your run configuration for CommandRunner.java to have the classpaths of the classes you want to see in your UML diagram as arguments separated by spaces
6. Run the CommandRunner class with this configuration
7. There should now be a .png file in the folder that your project is in with the automatically generated UML diagram
